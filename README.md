Original Survey: [flying-etiquette-survey](doc:https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/flying-etiquette-survey/flying-etiquette.csv)\
This repository contains a dataset and code for the analysis of a survey on airplane etiquette. The dataset includes responses from individuals regarding their travel habits, seat preferences, and opinions on various in-flight behaviors. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover interesting insights and patterns within the dataset.

## Hypotheses
1. Flying Frequency and Seat Reclining:
- Hypothesis: People who travel more frequently by plane are more likely to recline their seats during flights (flying more often lowers the inhibition threshold).
2. Family Status and Seat Etiquette:
- Hypothesis: People with children under 18 are more likely to find it acceptable to ask someone to switch seats to be closer to family.
3. Arm Rest Preferences and Gender:
- Hypothesis: Gender may influence preferences for the use of armrests, with certain genders having different expectations in sharing.
4. Age and Perceptions of Talking to Strangers:
- Hypothesis: Younger individuals find it less rude to engage in conversation with strangers during a flight compared to older individuals.
5. Seat Reclining consideration and Education:
- Hypothesis: People with higher education may feel a greater obligation to consider the impact of reclining their seats on the person behind them.
6. Seat Reclining and Smoking Rules Violation:
- Hypothesis: Individuals who have violated smoking rules in airplane bathrooms may also be more likely to recline their seats without consideration for the person behind them.
7. Regional Differences in Travel Etiquette:
- Hypothesis: There are regional differences in opinions on travel etiquette, such as whether it is considered rude to move to an unsold seat.
8. In-Flight Electronic Device Use and Age:
- Hypothesis: Younger people are more likely to use personal electronics during take-off or landing.
9. Influence of Household Income on Attitudes Towards Seat Reclining:
- Hypothesis: Individuals with higher household incomes may be more considerate of others and less likely to recline their seats, as they can afford other comfort options.
10. Attitude Towards Babies/Childern on Planes and Travel Experience:
- Hypothesis: Passengers who have had more extensive travel experience are more tolerant of babies/childern on planes, understanding the challenges of traveling with them.
